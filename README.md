This carefully designed dashboard aims to improve how to manage our organization by using data to enhance how well employees perform and stay with the company. It brings together various measures, like performance, engagement, attrition, and satisfaction, to be a useful tool for decision-makers. The goal is to give quick, real-time insights so we can act fast to lift employee spirits, find areas to make things better, and put in place specific plans that encourage a culture of growth, support, and empowerment.
           
           The key steps involved in this project include:
•	Data Preparation/Cleaning
•	Analysis and Visualization




Data Preparation/Cleaning

Cleaning the data involved tasks like filling in missing information, fixing how data is recorded, and setting the appropriate column headers. Doing this early on made it easier to learn more from the data. Making sure the data is good quality helps the organization understand what employees go through daily, making it easier to make decisions and create a friendly workplace. 

Furthermore, I created two new measures to enhance the analysis. The first               measure, “Attrition Rate,” is calculated by dividing the attrition count by the total number of employees. I employed the divide function for this calculation, providing a clear perspective on the attrition percentage. These measures contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of employee dynamics within the dataset.

Analysis and Visualization
As I mentioned before the goal of this project is to carry out an employee retention rate for an organization. An Employee Attrition analysis should answer the following questions:
1.	What is the current rate of employee departures observed within the organization due to voluntary reasons?
2.	From which academic fields did the departing individuals obtain their educational qualifications?
3.	What age groups constitute the segment of employees departing from the company?
4.	How does attrition vary based on the number of years employees have spent at the company?
5.	How does attrition differ across various income groups within the organization?
   



1.	What is the current rate of employee departures observed within the organization due to voluntary reasons?
The organization has a departure rate of 16.2%. This means that 229 employees left voluntarily during the studied period. The average salary of departing employees is $6.52k, which is important to understand how attrition affects our workforce and finances. The average age of the departing employees is 36 years.

                               . . .
2.	From which academic fields did the departing individuals obtain their educational qualifications?
I picked a donut chart to illustrate the diversity in employees’ educational backgrounds because it makes it easy to distinguish each group separately. Upon analysis, it’s apparent that the largest proportion of departing individuals, totaling 38.43%, have backgrounds in Life Science. Following closely are individuals from Medical backgrounds, making up the next significant portion. Interestingly, a notable percentage of departures come from individuals with marketing qualifications. Lastly, those with technical degrees represent the smallest fraction in the chart, accounting for only 13.97% of the total.

The high number of departures among those with Life Science backgrounds shows the need for focused attention and strategic efforts to reduce attrition in this group. Conversely, the lower departure rate among employees with technical degrees suggests there may be effective retention factors at play. Understanding these trends provides the company with insights to develop targeted retention strategies, particularly for individuals with Life Science and medical backgrounds.
                                            . . .
3. What age groups constitute the segment of employees departing from the company?
The bar graph shows that the highest number of employees leaving is in the age group of 26 to 35 years old, with a total of 111 individuals. Among them, 68 are males, as shown in the chart. Moving to the next age category of 36 to 45 years old, there are 41 departures, which is notably lower compared to the 26–35 age group. On the other hand, the age group of 55 and above has the fewest departures when compared to the other analyzed segments.

 4. How does attrition vary based on the number of years employees have spent at the company?

When looking at how many people leave the company in relation to their years of experience, a clear pattern stands out. Employees who have been with the company for 10 years show a much lower rate of leaving, with only 16 individuals, compared to the higher departure rate among those with 0–5 years of experience, totaling 57 departures.

5. How does attrition differ across various income groups within the organization?

The insights drawn from this analysis indicate that there is a correlation between salary levels and attrition rates within the company. Employees earning up to 5,000 experience the highest attrition, suggesting a potential relationship between lower salaries and turnover. Additionally, the observation of lower attrition rates among employees with salaries of 15,000 or more implies that higher compensation may contribute to enhanced employee retention. This highlights the importance of considering salary structures in retention strategies and potentially addressing challenges associated with lower income brackets.

Final Notes:
The dashboard includes buttons that, when selected, filter out specific data. These buttons allow you to sort data based on gender (males or females) if needed.

From the image above, you can see that the choices for “male” and “female” have been selected. This means the dashboard will now display data according to the gender selected.

Conclusion
In summary, the thorough analysis carried out using Power BI provides valuable insights into different aspects of employee attrition. The trends highlighted in this report point to important areas that need attention and specific actions to enhance employee retention within the organization.
